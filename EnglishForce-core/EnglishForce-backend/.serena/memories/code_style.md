# Code Style and Conventions

This project follows standard JavaScript and Node.js conventions. Here are some of the key style points observed in the codebase:

- **Modules:** The project uses ES6 modules (`import` and `export`).
- **Asynchronous Operations:** Asynchronous operations are handled using `async/await`.
- **Naming Conventions:** Variables and function names are written in `camelCase`.
- **Semicolons:** Semicolons are used at the end of statements.
- **Quotes:** Both single and double quotes are used for strings. Please try to be consistent with the existing code in the file you are editing.
- **Comments:** JSDoc-style comments are used to document functions and their parameters.

Since there are no explicit linting or formatting configurations (like ESLint or Prettier), please pay close attention to the existing code and maintain a consistent style.
