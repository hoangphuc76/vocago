              Kyle, there are no projectors here. I've called the IT department and asked if they have any spare ones. I'll get back to you when I get a reply.
              
              Kyle 3:00
              
              Thanks again. Oh and can you check for extra microphones?

              There are two here. I'll take them both. Meanwhile, the IT department says they don't have extra projectors but they'll send a guy down now to check what's wrong. They say it worked fine at yesterday's presentation.
              
              Kyle 3:09
              
              Great! I'll see you soon then.`,

              After a months-long battle to stop the development of a new shopping mall on the location of the former Rivervalley Courthouse, residents, local businesses, and civic groups are cheering the decision to keep the 150-year-old building intact. —[1]— "We're disappointed," added Branford Construction's CEO. "We felt that the community would benefit and grow, but obviously, residents want to preserve their history and I respect that!"
              
              Instead, efforts are being made to restore the old deserted courthouse to its former glory. -[2]- "The community is getting together for this and we are collecting donations to have the building renovated," said local resident Enid Tran. "We hope to make a public library or school out of the building."
              
              -[3]- "It's been here for as long as I can remember. In fact, my grandfather worked as a clerk there," added a local business owner, Kevin Lamb, "It's an iconic symbol of our community and we don't want it destroyed." The community has already raised over $100,000 through an online petition and donations keep pouring in. —[4]— The community hopes that restoration of the building begins within the next couple of months.`,

              Dear Ms. Johnson,
              
              District Management at Topline Electronics would like to inform you about a new development that will be affecting your store. Another competing consumer electronics store will be opening in the Crayville area on November 12.
              
              In order to ensure that Topline Electronics does not lose business to this new store, District Management is advising you to run a special sale on our new line of curved UHD televisions. These televisions provide state-of-the-art features at moderate prices. By showing your customers that Topline Electronics offers the best deals in the area, you will be able to maintain customer loyalty. We will be shipping the new televisions to your store within the next week. We suggest you prepare a prominent display space in your store to feature them. You should also update your website to advertise the sale.
              
              Smooth communication between you and us is vital to effective operational practices. If you have any questions concerning the new televisions or the marketing campaign in general, please don't hesitate to contact District Management.
              
              Sincerely,

              District Manager,

              Jordan, Johnny 10:11
              
              Monica is waiting to hear from them. Last I heard, there has been a bit of delay due to problems at the manufacturing site. Apparently one of the conveyor belts is down.
              
              Nickson, Harry 10:12

              Jordan, Johnny 10:13
              
              No, because I want to get a definitive answer from our manufacturers first before I relay any sort of a message about a delay. Hey Monica, have you gotten a response yet?
              
              Stein, Monica 10:14
              
              Yes, I just spoke with them. Great news, it looks like we can get the job done on Friday as originally scheduled. The desks and chairs will arrive directly at P&R Industries from the assembly lines on Thursday.
              
              Nickson, Harry 10:15
              
              That's great to hear. Please inform Mr. Kline about this. We can get started on 5th-floor offices and work our way down once the furniture arrives.
              
              Stein, Monica 10:15
              
              I'm on it.
              
              Jordan, Johnny 10:16
              
              Alright, and I'll get a large crew there so that the work can be finished by Friday as planned.
              
              Nickson, Harry 10:17
              
              Yes, please make sure that the job is done not only efficiently but also well. They have a couple of other buildings that they may want our services for.

Getting a seat or table at Health Shack can take as long as 30 minutes on a good day and the place is always crowded no matter the time of day. Health Shack offers only six items on its menu; all are protein shakes including the best sellers, Apple Pie, Peanut Butter Cup, and Tuity Fruity. —[2]— "We were overwhelmed by the response," says Jill Baker. "In fact, everything spread by word of mouth so we didn't even need to advertise." Fitness Instructor Julian Miles said, "I love coming here for a quick lunch that won't wreck my fitness goals. I even recommend this place to all my patrons." —[3]— "I come here to get a healthy but satisfying meal during my short break with my co-workers," added businessman Tim Hammer. "Without Health Shack, we'd be eating junk food." —[4]— Health Shack is open from 7:00 A.M. to 8:00 P.M. from Mondays through Fridays, and from 9:00 A.M. to 7:00 P.M. on Saturdays. It closes on Sundays. The owners hope to add new flavors to the menu in the coming months.`,

              Dear Ms. Flores,
              
              I work for Facilities Management here at Wurnster University. It was recently brought to my attention that there is a scheduling conflict concerning one of your lecture dates. Room 305 has been reserved for every Wednesday this semester by the Wurnster Debate Club. Therefore, I'm sorry to inform you that you will need to move the location or the time of this talk. You can visit the facilities management website in order to check the availability of other room locations and reschedule the talk.

<strong>Subject</strong>: Food Delivery</p>

<p>To whom it may concern,</p>

<p><span>My name is Emily Hall and I am the owner of a vegetarian restaurant located in downtown Huntsville. I am contacting you because I am interested in receiving regular shipments of fresh, organic vegetables to my restaurant weekly. My restaurant is just starting, so I do not need a large quantity of goods. After looking into different farms in the area, I chose to contact Bountiful Harvest because of your promise to deliver certified organic food. Therefore, I would like to receive a price estimate for the cost of having fresh vegetables delivered directly to our restaurant on a weekly basis.</span></p>

<p>Dear Ms. Singh,</p>

<p>Thank you for responding so promptly to my email. I appreciate the offer of the complimentary delivery, but I think I would like to just go ahead and set up regular deliveries. I may be interested in setting up a year's worth of deliveries, but I would first like to get a list of the range of produce that you will be offering through the different seasons. As I own a vegetarian restaurant, I will need to have an idea of the types of produce that will be delivered so I can prepare my menus accordingly. Thank you so much for your consideration, and I look forward to working with Bountiful Harvest!</p>

<p>Kind regards,</p>

              Dear Castelli customers,
              
              Our quality assurance team has revealed that five hundred jars of Castelli's Classic Spaghetti Sauce do not meet our high standards of product quality.
              
              The defect has been caused by an improper seal on the lid of the jar and may have resulted in the contents spoiling due to contact with air. We are currently warning customers not to eat this product.
              
              What you should do: If you have already purchased a jar of Castelli's Classic Spaghetti Sauce, please send an e-mail to our Customer Service Department at cs@castellifood.com. One of our employees will provide you with a product replacement voucher. Please include your name, full address, phone number, and the product's serial number in the e-mail. Customers will receive a $12 voucher for each jar purchased. Please do not try to get a refund for this product at a retailer.
              
              Please remember that no other Castelli food products are affected. We encourage you to continue purchasing our products.

              My name is Tony Hester and I appreciate the precautionary step. Around two weeks ago I purchased two jars of Castelli's Classic Spaghetti Sauce from an Ace grocery store in Hermantown, Minnesota. A week later, I purchased one more jar of it at the same place.  
              
              I have attached the image file of both receipts to this e-mail. I would like to receive a product replacement voucher for these defective products. My address is:

              Thank you very much for contacting Castelli Foods. We are committed to ensuring that our customers can continue to rely on the Castelli line of quality foods for all their dining needs.

Please accept these as another way for us to say that we are sorry, and we hope that you continue to turn to us for delicious Italian flavors.

<p><strong>MEMO</strong></p>

<p><strong>To</strong>: All Employees (employees@politospizza.com)<br>
<strong>From</strong>: Greg Kluck (gregkluck@politospizza.com)<br>
<strong>Subject</strong>: Inspection Results<br>
<strong>Date</strong>: January 25</p>

<p>Dear employees,</p>

<p>The results from our recent inspection on January 22 indicate that there are a few problems that we need to address.</p>

<p>First, it was brought to my attention that fire exit signs need to be installed again. The most serious violation concerned the improper storage and labeling of food. All ingredients stored for later use must be labeled with an exact date and detailed contents. If we do not label containers properly, spoiled food could accidently be served to customers. We received relatively low grades for employee hygiene and the cleanliness of our facilities. All employees are required to wear their uniform and hairnet at all times and wash their hands after every bathroom visit. We also need to mop floors more often and keep them dry.</p>

<p>In order to correct these poor situations, I will be posting a checklist that all employees will be required to complete every morning. It will include necessary preparations to ensure that we are not breaking any regulations. This measure will go into effect on January 29.</p>

<p>If you have any questions about these changes, please bring them up at the staff meeting tomorrow.</p>

<p>-------------------------</p>

<p><strong>NOTICE TO ALL EMPLOYEES</strong></p>

<p>The checklist below must be signed by every employee on every day that they have a shift at Polito's Pizza. Only sign the task once it has been completed or checked. Failure to fill out the checklist with the date, time, and signature will be treated as a violation of Polito's new health standards.</p>
