# Code Style and Conventions

This project is a standard Create React App application and follows its default code style and conventions.

- **Component-Based Architecture:** The application is built using a component-based architecture, with components organized into `Pages` and `Components` directories.
- **Functional Components and Hooks:** The codebase primarily uses functional components with React Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useContext`, etc.) for managing state and side effects.
- **JSX:** The project uses JSX for writing UI components.
- **Styling:** Material-UI (`@mui/material`) is used for UI components and styling. The `sx` prop is used for custom styling.
- **Linting:** The project uses the default ESLint configuration from Create React App (`react-app` and `react-app/jest`). This helps maintain a consistent code style and catch common errors.

When contributing to the codebase, please adhere to the existing style and conventions.
