# English Force

**This project is my Graduation Project in University (Final Year Project) focused on developing an online English learning platform.**

English Force is an online English learning platform that helps users study effectively through diverse courses, lessons, exercises, and exams. The project consists of three main parts: a React frontend and a Node.js backend with PostgreSQL database and a FastAI backend that run my AI models.
